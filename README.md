# ByteTrack: Multi-Object Tracking Library

This library provides a Rust port of the [Python library](https://github.com/FoundationVision/ByteTrack) of the [ByteTrack algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06864) for multi-object tracking (MOT) in real-time and computer vision applications. ByteTrack is also in [Multi-Object Tracking with Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/de/modes/track/).
